                            In simple terms, User Interface (UI) is the outer body part of the product, with which the user can interact, like layout, colors, typography, buttons, icons, and other visual elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whereas, User Experience (UX) is how these elements and the project as a whole function. The why, how, and by which answers of visual elements are covered in the UX research process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Together, UI and UX complete the process of easing the user journey throughout the product navigation. Beautifully crafted UI grabs user attention, and well-functioning UX makes it easy for the user to use the product.
